# The Simple X Hotkey Daemon is the program used by LARBS to map most of the

# dwm-independent commands.  This file is pretty readable, so I'll let you read
# it.

# The keys NOT bound here by sxhkd, but by dwm or i3 are:
# The t thru p keys on the top row
# The f thru ; keys on the home row
# The b key on the bottom row (hides the bar in either case)

# Basic binds
